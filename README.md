<H1>Titanic Survival Analysis â€” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</H1>
<P>The Titanic disaster remains one of the most tragic maritime events in history, with the sinking of the ship on April 15, 1912, after striking an iceberg. Out of 2224 passengers and crew, more than 1500 lost their lives, it serves as a critical dataset to study survival trends based on demographics, socioeconomic factors, and more.

This project uses the famous Titanic dataset to explore patterns of survival through in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
